            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                KKTPlus offers a classic mobile game. Our Privacy Policy applies whenever you use our “Services,” which means our games,
                products, services, content, http://kktplus.com, and/or other domains or websites operated by KKTPlus. It describes the ways
                we use your information and your rights and choices concerning your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                KKTPlus develops and publishes social games for mobile devices. “KKTPlus,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Privacy Policy
                refers to KKTPlus and any other corporate entities under common ownership with KKTPlus (“Affiliated Entities”).
            </p>
            <p>For purposes of data protection laws, KKTPlus is the “data controller” of your personal information.</p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies whenever you use our “Services,” which means our games, products, services, content,
                http://kktplus.com, and/or other domains or websites operated by KKTPlus. It describes how we collect, store, use, and
                disclose your personal information when providing these Services to you, and your rights and choices concerning your
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want KKTPlus to collect, store, use, or share your information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy,
                you may not play KKTPlus's games or use KKTPlus's other Services.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>
            <p>
                We'll collect and store any information that you provide to us, including when you create your account or a player profile.
            </p>
            <p>Information About You That You Share With Us Directly</p>
            <p>
                When you use our Services, you may give us information directly (like when you're setting up your account), and we'll store
                that information on our systems and use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some games or parts of our Services may use a more traditional registration or account set-up process where you may be asked
                to give us information like:
            </p>
            <p>your first and last name;</p>
            <p>your username;</p>
            <p>your gender;</p>
            <p>your age or birthday;</p>
            <p>your e-mail address;</p>
            <p>a password; and/or</p>
            <p>other information that helps us make sure it's you accessing your account or helps us improve our services.</p>
            <p>
                We may also let you create a player profile that other KKTPlus players can see. Your player profile may include information
                like:
            </p>
            <p>your profile photo;</p>
            <p>your first and last name;</p>
            <p>your game username;</p>
            <p>your gender;</p>
            <p>your biographic details (like your age or age range);</p>
            <p>the approximate physical location information that you provide;</p>
            <p>links to your profiles on various social networks;</p>
            <p>details about the games you play; and/or</p>
            <p>
                a KKTPlus User ID that is created by KKTPlus and used to identify your game account (on KKTPlus app, your KKTPlus User ID
                will appear in your profile page).
            </p>
            <p>If you give us your mobile telephone number, we will also collect and store that number.</p>
            <p>Information About Your Contacts</p>
            <p>We'll collect information that you provide to us about your contacts, but be sure to ask their permission first.</p>
            <p>
                WWe may give you the ability to import your address book contacts or to manually enter them so that you can locate your
                contacts using KKTPlus Services and invite them to join you in our games or other aspects of our Services. You are
                responsible for getting your contacts' permission before you give their contact details to us. We may also get information
                about you from other KKTPlus users importing or entering their contacts. We use and may store this contact information to
                help you and your contacts connect through our Services. If you want to remove your contacts stored by us, follow any
                instructions provided in the Service to request that we remove them from our systems or Contact Us.
            </p>
            <p>Information You Generate Using Our Services</p>
            <p>We'll collect information about the ways you use and interact with our Services.</p>
            <p>
                When you use our Services, we'll collect information about the ways in which you use and interact with our Services, such as
                when and for how long you play our games, game features and other players you interact with, purchases you make, progress or
                levels you achieve, and other gameplay activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use communication features in KKTPlus Services that allow you to communicate or share information with
                other players, then we'll collect information on what is communicated or shared.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may access in real-time, record, and/or store archives of these communications, comments, photos, drawings, and other
                user-generated content on KKTPlus's servers to make use of them to protect the safety and well-being of our players; to
                protect KKTPlus's rights and property in connection with our Services; to conduct research; to operate, improve,
                personalize, and optimize our Services and our players' experiences, including through the use of analytics; and to manage
                and deliver advertising. Where required by law, we will seek your consent for this.
            </p>
            <p>Payment Information</p>
            <p>We'll collect information related to any purchases you make.</p>
            <p>
                When you play KKTPlus's games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or platforms (like
                Google), any purchases you make will be processed by that third-party application and subject to that third-party
                application's terms of service and privacy policy. For these purchases, KKTPlus does not receive your financial information,
                but may receive non-financial information related to your purchases, like your name, approximate physical location, and the
                items purchased. The information KKTPlus receives depends on the third-party application. KKTPlus's Terms of Service explain
                our policies and terms related to charges, billing, third-party credits, and virtual currencies. Please note that purchases
                of third-party credits or currencies are also subject to those parties' terms of service and privacy policies.
            </p>
            <p>Customer Support Correspondence</p>
            <p>We'll keep a record of any correspondence between us.</p>
            <p>
                When you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them
                (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your KKTPlus
                User and/or social network ID number. We will also store the communications you have with our Customer Service team and any
                additional information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services.
            </p>
            <p>Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks</p>
            <p>
                We'll collect some information from other companies, including social networks, if you access our games through your
                accounts with those companies or you choose to connect your accounts with those companies to our games.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you play KKTPlus's games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our
                Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, KKTPlus may receive certain information
                about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the third-party
                application, your privacy settings, and, if applicable, your friends' privacy settings on that third-party application.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, KKTPlus may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the connected
                third-party application:
            </p>
            <p>your first and last name;</p>
            <p>your profile picture or its URL;</p>
            <p>
                your user identification number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like
                your name and profile photo;
            </p>
            <p>your friends' user ID numbers and other public data;</p>
            <p>the e-mail address you provided to that third-party application;</p>
            <p>your approximate physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services;</p>
            <p>your gender;</p>
            <p>your birthday, age, and/or age range;</p>
            <p>information about your activities on or through the connected third-party application;</p>
            <p>other publicly-available information on the third-party application; and/or</p>
            <p>any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with KKTPlus.</p>
            <p>
                If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should
                also read that third-party application's terms of service and privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party
                application to find out more about their privacy practices.
            </p>
            <p>Automated Information Collection</p>
            <p>We'll collect information about your device and how you use our Services.</p>
            <p>In some cases, we will connect the information with your social network ID or KKTPlus User ID.</p>
            <p>
                If you play KKTPlus games on a mobile device, in addition to your device identifiers (described above), we may also collect:
            </p>
            <p>the name you have associated with your device;</p>
            <p>your country;</p>
            <p>your telephone number (if you provide it);</p>
            <p>your specific geolocation (with your permission); and/or</p>
            <p>information about the KKTPlus games and other third-party apps you have on your device.</p>
            <p>Other Sources</p>
            <p>We may collect information from other third-party sources. Where we do, we'll let you know.</p>
            <p>
                We may collect or receive information about you from other sources like third-party information providers. We use this
                information along with information you provide us directly, for example, to help you and your friends connect or to serve
                you advertising more tailored to your interests.
            </p>
            <h2>3. How We Use Information We Collect and Our Legal Bases for Processing It</h2>
            <p>
                We use your information to provide, personalize, maintain the security of, and improve the Services you use; to maintain our
                business operations; and to exercise, defend or establish our rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use your information under several legal bases, including to perform our contract with you, for our legitimate business
                interests, to comply with our legal obligations, or otherwise with your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide you with the Services you request from us and to improve
                your gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:
            </p>
            <p>to improve and optimize our Services and our players' experiences;</p>
            <p>to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;</p>
            <p>to identify and suggest connections with other KKTPlus players and personalize our Services to you;</p>
            <p>
                to communicate with you about the Services you're using, including in-game updates, new Services, and promotional offers
                that we think might be of interest to you;
            </p>
            <p>to enable players to communicate with each other;</p>
            <p>to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;</p>
            <p>to protect the safety and well-being of our players;</p>
            <p>to protect KKTPlus's rights and property in connection with our Services;</p>
            <p>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service;</p>
            <p>to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;</p>
            <p>
                to administer rewards, surveys, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our
                business partners;
            </p>
            <p>
                to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our
                agreements with third parties; and/or
            </p>
            <p>to conduct research.</p>
            <p>
                However, we'll normally collect information from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms
                of Service), where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren't overridden by your interests or
                rights), or if we otherwise have your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect information from you or may otherwise need the
                personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another player).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will
                normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to
                provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of
                Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing
                information is mandatory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, if we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it
                will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and
                marketing, for example).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have questions or need further information about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal
                information, please Contact Us.
            </p>
            <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>
            <p>
                We'll share your information with third parties when you use our Services under the circumstances described in this
                subsection.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll share some of your information with your friends and other KKTPlus players that you're playing with to facilitate your
                gaming interactions with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties or allow third parties to collect this
                information from our Services in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <p>Friends and Other KKTPlus Players</p>
            <p>
                KKTPlus's games and Services support and often encourage you to interact with other players. In many KKTPlus games, other
                players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends, will be able to see your player profile (as described
                above); view descriptions of your in-game activity; and communicate with you within our Services. For example, in KKTPlus,
                when you are playing at a table, all the other players at the same table can see your player profile and send you an in-game
                chat message.
            </p>
            <p>Third-Party Advertising Including Behavioral Advertising and Analytics</p>
            <p>
                We'll share some of your information with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your
                interests and to enable us to offer some of our Services for free.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games, game features, and other Services for free. These advertisements
                may include, without limitation, banner ads on game boards or Services themselves, as full-screen ads between moves or
                games, or through an “offer wall” in which third-party advertisers offer to provide virtual currency or other in-game items
                to players in exchange for watching an advertisement or for completing a task, such as signing up for an account with one of
                the advertisers, completing a survey, or finishing a particular game level. Offer walls are hosted by third-party offer wall
                providers, and the offers are made by third-party advertisers, not by KKTPlus.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not actively share personal information that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct
                marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable advertisers, ad networks, and offer wall providers to serve you with more relevant ads, they may collect, or we
                may collect and share with them, the following types of information when you use our Services:
            </p>
            <p>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</p>
            <p>
                certain technical information (like IP address, non-persistent device identifier such as IDFA, and de-identified persistent
                device identifier such as a hashed Android ID);

            <p>
                Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications in our Services and between you and KKTPlus may be
                accessed and monitored as needed to provide our Service and may be disclosed:

                authorities, including for national security, law enforcement, or legal process purposes (for example, a court order, search
                warrant, or subpoena);
            </p>
            <p>
                when we believe in our sole discretion that our Services are being used in committing a crime, including to report such
                criminal activity or to share information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection,
                credit risk reduction, and other security precautions;
            </p>
            <p>
                when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another

            <p>Third-Party Service Providers</p>
            <p>
                We'll share your information with the third-party service providers and business partners that we work with to bring you our
                Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will share your information with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing,
                analytics, analysis, hosting services, customer service, marketing, and advertising optimization. We will also share your
                information with our third-party business partners who assist us in delivering and optimizing our Services, such as our
                platform partners (Google, etc.). Where we share your information with third-party service providers and business partners,
                we ensure that we have appropriate agreements in place to protect your information (as required by applicable data
                protection laws).

            <p>Sale or Merger</p>
            <p>We'll share your information with the interested party if we undergo or evaluate undergoing a sale or merger.</p>
            <p>
                In the event that KKTPlus undergoes or evaluates undergoing a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another
                company, or sale of all or part of its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information,
                including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts to let you
                and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy) of the business transition before
                transferring your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>Other Third Parties</p>
            <p>We may share some of your information with other third parties if we have your consent to do so.</p>

                In addition to the sharing described above, we may share your information with other third parties or allow them to collect
                your information from our Services in some ways not specifically described in this Privacy Policy if we have your consent to

            <p>You can access or request deletion of your personal information by submitting a request.</p>
            <p>
                You can correct or update your personal information, object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict
                processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.

                You can opt-out of marketing communications we send you by following the instructions in “Opting Out of Promotional
                Communications from KKTPlus” below.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any
                time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor
                will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
                consent.
            </p>
            <p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.</p>
            <p>
                To exercise your rights to access or deletion, please submit a request. If you would like to exercise any of your other
                rights, you can Contact Us. We respond to all data protection requests we receive in accordance with applicable data
                protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>Accessing and Deleting Personal Information Held by KKTPlus</p>
            <p>You can request a copy of or deletion of your game account data.</p>
            <p>
                To review and update personal information associated with your KKTPlus player profile in certain games, visit the “settings”
                page in that game.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to review or delete personal information associated with your game account data, please submit a request. If you
                have any problems, please Contact Us.
            </p>
            <p>
                For deletion requests, we will take reasonable measures to delete your personal information from our records. If you have
                sent content through or posted content on the Service, we may not be able to delete it. We will keep certain records (e.g.,
                personal information relating to payments or customer service matters) where we need (and have rights) to, such as for legal
                or accounting purposes. We'll also keep information in order to exercise, defend, or establish our rights.
            </p>
            <p>Managing Personal Information We Receive From Third-Party Applications / Platforms And From Your Mobile Device</p>
            <p>
                To manage the information we receive from third-party applications or platforms and from your mobile device, use the tools
                and settings provided by the third-party application and your mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage the information KKTPlus receives about you from a third-party application or platform where you play our games,
                like Facebook, Google, you will need to follow the third-party application's instructions for updating your information and
                changing your privacy settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also can manage many aspects of information collection and use from your mobile device by visiting the “settings” page
                of your mobile device and reviewing the access permissions of each KKTPlus game / application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once KKTPlus receives your information from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that information is
                stored and used by KKTPlus in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described
                above.
            </p>
            <p>Opting Out of Promotional Communications from KKTPlus</p>
            <p>You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device's settings page.</p>
            <p>
                If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the
                app is not on, you can turn off push notifications by visiting your mobile device's “settings” page. Many of our games also
                offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “settings” page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time
                to time if we need to provide you with information about the Services you are using from us, if we need to request
                information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for
                example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising</p>
            <p>You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.</p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile
                web advertising from third parties, you may visit the following websites:
            </p>
            <p>
                Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based
                advertising; and
            </p>
            <p>Your Online Choices website for EU-based advertising.</p>
            <p>
                If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on
                your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”). You can
                also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device's settings page, which will prevent
                continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform
                provider (such as Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's “AppChoices” app,
                that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by KKTPlus. KKTPlus does not
                control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in KKTPlus's Services after using these opt-out tools, but
                the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Privacy Policies of Linked Third-Party Services and Advertisers</h2>
            <p>
                We aren't responsible for the ways in which third parties use your information (other than our service providers acting
                under our instructions).
            </p>
            <p>
                Our websites and games may contain advertisements from “Third-Party Services,” meaning companies other than KKTPlus, that
                may link to their own websites, online services, or mobile applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or
                the content of these Third-Party Services. If you have any questions about how these Third-Party Services use your
                information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.
            </p>
            <h2>7. Our Policies Concerning Children</h2>
            <p>We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children.</p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (collectively, “Children”).
                Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though our Services do not target Children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to
                proceed for certain Services. For users who identify themselves as Children in our age-gate on such Services, if we allow
                Children to use the Services, we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose
                “personal information” (as defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)), except as permitted by COPPA,
                or obtain legally valid parental consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception from a Child,
                we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.
            </p>
            <h2>8. International Operations</h2>
            <p>When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.</p>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT: When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other
                countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our “Affiliated Entities,” which are any
                other corporate entities under common ownership with KKTPlus, or to our business partners and service providers from time to
                time for our legitimate business purposes. For example, KKTPlus provides certain services to its Affiliated Entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data we hold may also be processed by employees who work for us, one of our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business
                partners or service providers. This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your
                payment details, or (ii) the provision of support services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we
                will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we
                describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places
                where your information is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable
                to the place where you are resident.
            </p>
            <h2>9. How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                We'll keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, maintain our legitimate business
                operations, and/or exercise, defend or establish our rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your
                personal information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as
                long as you have an active account with us. We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you
                delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after you have closed, or we have deleted,
                your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our
                rights.
            </p>
            <h2>10. Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We work hard to protect your information but you also have a role to play.</p>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and
                offline and to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures vary
                based upon the sensitivity of your information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have an account registered directly with KKTPlus, your profile information is protected by the password you use to
                access your KKTPlus account. It is important that you protect and maintain your KKTPlus account's security and that you
                immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your KKTPlus account, the
                Services allow you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. If you access our
                Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to
                someone accessing or deleting your KKTPlus game accounts without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network
                account information, including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your KKTPlus
                account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.
            </p>
            <p>When you sign into your KKTPlus account, we use encryption to transmit that information.</p>
            <p>
                While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no
                website or Internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
                other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to
                our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please Contact
                Us.
            </p>
            <h2>11. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We'll let you know about any material changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
                If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game
                or on http://kktplus.com, or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes
                effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law). We may supplement this process by placing notices on
                game blogs, social network pages, and/or player forums. You should periodically check http://kktplus.com and this Privacy
                Policy for updates.
