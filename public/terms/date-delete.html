                If you choose to delete your Vue Test account, we will delete all personal information that you have provided to us in our service. This includes your name, date of
                birth, email address, and in some cases, payment information. We will begin this process immediately upon receiving your deletion request, but please note that due
                to
                technical reasons, this process may take a few days to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we may need to retain some information to fulfill our legal or contractual obligations. For example, we may need to retain some information to
                process
                any transactions you may have initiated, or to meet our financial record retention requirements. In these cases, we will only retain the necessary information and
                only
                for the necessary period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions about our data deletion policy, or if you wish to delete your account, please contact our customer service team.
