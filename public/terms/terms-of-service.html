            <p>
                We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms, Community Rules, or Feature Terms at any time by posting the
                amended Terms, Community Rules, or Feature Terms on our sites or within the Services (such as through in-game notices). We may provide additional notice, such as an
                e-mail message or messaging within the Services, of any material changes. Unless we state otherwise, changes are effective when posted. New versions of the Terms,
                Community Rules, and Feature Terms, and any other policies, codes, or rules will be accessible at www.vue-test.site or from within the Services. If you
                continue to use the Services after the changes are posted, you are agreeing that the changes apply to your continued use of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can't make changes to the Terms, Community Rules, or Feature Terms unless both you and Vue Test sign a written amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a dispute with Vue Test, the version of the Terms, Community Rules, and Feature Terms in effect at the time Vue Test received actual notice of the
                dispute will apply to such dispute.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Terms or our Privacy Policy have any provisions or information that conflict with other Vue Test terms or policies, these Terms and the Privacy Policy as
                applicable shall govern.

            <h2>
                3. ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND SECURITY
            </h2>
            <p>
                In order to use our Services, we may ask you to create an Account and select a password and/or provide us with certain personal information, which may include your
                name, birth date, e-mail address, and, in some cases, payment information. This information will be held and used in accordance with Vue Test's Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree to supply Vue Test with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information, particularly your email address.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account. Don't share your Account details with others or allow others to access or use your Account. We
                will treat all acts performed through your Account as being performed by you. You therefore accept responsibility for all acts done using your Account, whether or
                not authorized by you, including purchases made using any payment instrument (for example, credit card or PayPal), and you understand you may be held liable for
                losses incurred by us or any other user of the Services caused by someone else using your Account.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you become aware of any actual or suspected loss, theft, fraud, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password, please tell us immediately.

                4. USING OUR SERVICES
            </h2>
            <p>
                Who can use our Services?
            </p>
            <p>
                We are excited to have you start playing our games, but there are some limits on who can use our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not use our Services if:
            </p>
            <p>
                • You cannot enter into a binding contract with Vue Test.
            </p>
            <p>
                • You are under 13 years of age (or under 16, if you are located in the European Economic Area (the "EEA")), in which case you must not create an Account, use any
                of our Services, or submit personal information in the Services or to Vue Test (for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address). This
                prohibition does not apply if, and only if, a Vue Test Service has an age-gate that collects age information before allowing a user to proceed and that age-gate
                allows users who identify themselves as under 13 years of age (or under 16 in the EEA) to use the Service. (As described in our Privacy Policy, in those instances,
                we will either provide a version of that Service that does not collect, use, or disclose personal information, except where and to the extent permitted by
                applicable data protection laws, including without limitation the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or obtain legally valid parental consent.)
            </p>
            <p>
                • You are not allowed to receive products, including services or software, from the United States, for example if you are located in a country embargoed by the
                United States or if you are on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals.
            </p>
            <p>
                • You are a convicted sex offender.
            </p>
            <p>
                • You have previously been banned from playing any Vue Test game or using any Vue Test Service, unless Vue Test has reversed that ban, in its sole
                discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are under the age of 18, or under the age of majority where you are located, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOUR LEGAL GUARDIAN HAS REVIEWED AND AGREED TO THESE TERMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional Important Rules and Terms
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use our Services, you must follow the Vue Test Community Rules and all other Feature Terms that may apply. These additional rules and terms apply in
                addition to these Terms and are important. Please read them. If you access the Services from a social network, such as Facebook, or download the Services from Apple
                or Google, you must also comply with that third party's terms of service/use as well as these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessing our Services
            </p>
            <p>
                To access or play our games or create an Account with us, you may need an account with a social network, like Facebook, and, if you are using our mobile Services,
                an account with the company that provides your mobile applications, like an Apple iTunes account. You may need to update third-party software from time to time to
                receive the Services and play Vue Test's Games.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide the games and other Services. You provide the equipment (phone, or tablet, etc.) and pay any fees to connect to the Internet and app stores, and for data
                or cellular usage to download and use the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Service Changes and Limitations
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Services are evolving and we may require that you accept updates to the Services as well as to the Terms, Community Rules, Feature Rules, and the Vue Test
                Privacy Policy. From time to time we may make you update the game or your software to continue to use our Services. We may perform these updates remotely, including
                to Vue Test software residing on your mobile device, without notifying you.
                Vue Test reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or a particular game or part of the Services at any time either permanently or
                temporarily and without having to provide any reasons therefor, at which point your right to use the Services or any part of them will be automatically terminated
                or suspended. If that happens, unless applicable law requires otherwise, Vue Test is not required to provide refunds, benefits, or other compensation to you in
                connection with discontinued elements of the Services or for Virtual Items previously earned or purchased.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vue Test MAY, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, LIMIT, SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ACCOUNTS OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OR ANY PORTION OF THEM; PROHIBIT ACCESS TO
                OUR GAMES AND SITES, AND THEIR CONTENT, SERVICES, AND TOOLS; OR DELAY OR REMOVE HOSTED CONTENT, AND Vue Test IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY
                LOSSES OR RESULTS. This does not apply to users located in the EEA. If you are located in the EEA, we will endeavor to give you at least one month's notice of any
                material changes before they take effect, and if you are unhappy with those changes, you can choose to cancel your Services under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deleting your Account
            </p>
            <p>
                You may stop using our Services at any time and may request that we delete your Account at any time by following the instructions in our Privacy Policy. Unless
                applicable law requires otherwise, we are not required to provide refunds, benefits, or other compensation if you request deletion of your Account.
            </p>

                Lawful Jurisdiction
            </p>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for knowing the lawful status of online gambling, or any other activity associated with our Services, that may be deemed to be unlawful
                in your country. For example: In Australia, the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 (Cth) ("IGA") provides that prohibited interactive gambling services must not be
                provided to customers in Australia. Accordingly, unlicensed online casino gambling is illegal, and you may not use our Services as a "real world" money gambling
                means.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your country allows your use of our Services under its laws. We accept no responsibility or liability for any adverse
                action, or loss of any kind, that is associated with your unlawful utilization of our Services within a disallowed jurisdiction. Should you engage in any
                unauthorized use of our Services such as by using it for "real-world" money gambling, you shall indemnify Vue Test against any liability arising from your
                unauthorized actions. Vue Test shall in that event be entitled to take any further action against you (including undertaking an investigation as per Section 6)
                for such unauthorized use of our Services, including the suspension or termination of your access to our Services.

            <p>
                The Services are comprised of works that are owned or licensed by Vue Test, and they are protected by copyright, trademark, trade dress, patent, and other
                worldwide intellectual property rights and other applicable laws, rules, or regulations. All such rights are reserved. These Terms do not grant you or any other
                party any right, title, or interest in the Services or any content in the Services.
                So long as you abide by these Terms and any other rules, including the Community Rules and any Feature Terms, you may use the Services subject to these Terms, for
                your own non-commercial, entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose and agree that Vue Test will have no liability to you
                for any damage or loss arising from unauthorized uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you breach these Terms, or any of our other terms that apply to you, we may take action against you, up to and including terminating your account. In addition,
                you may be breaking the law, including breaches or violations of Vue Test's intellectual property rights. ANY ATTEMPT BY YOU TO DISRUPT OR INTERFERE WITH THE
                SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION UNDERMINING OR MANIPULATING THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF ANY Vue Test GAME, IS A BREACH OF Vue Test POLICY AND MAY BE A
                BREACH OR VIOLATION OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your Account and Virtual Items
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of any other statement in these Terms, the Community Rules, or any Feature Terms that apply to features you may choose to use, you do not own any Account
                that you create on our Services, including in our games, and your Account is not your property. Likewise, you do not own any Virtual Items that you obtained through
                our Services, regardless of whether you "earned" those Virtual Items or "purchased" them. Your Account and any related Virtual Items are owned by Vue Test. Vue 
                Test gives you a limited license and right to use your Account and the related Virtual Items while we offer the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                TO AVOID RETAINING DATA THAT IS NO LONGER NEEDED AND/OR TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES, WE MAY DELETE OR TERMINATE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE INACTIVE (I.E., NOT LOGGED INTO) FOR
                180 DAYS.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are not allowed to transfer Virtual Items outside of the Services (e.g., in the "real world"), for example by selling, gifting, or trading them. We won't
                recognize those transfers as legitimate. You are not allowed to sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for "real" money, or exchange Virtual
                Items for value of any kind outside of a game. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and we may terminate your Account because of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, if you are located in a jurisdiction where online gambling is unlawful, you may be in breach of that jurisdiction's gambling laws by using our Services
                to gamble and convert the Virtual Items of that gambling to "real world" money. This conduct is unlawful in Australia for example. Our Services have been solely
                designed for the use of users and clubs to engage in social gaming that does not involve the use of "real world" money. The Services are expressly not licensed to
                operate outside of a closed economy of Virtual Items. The Virtual Items used within our Services are in no way intended to be transferable, convertible, comparable,
                or used in place of "real world" money. We do not condone any secondary market between clubs and/or users that seeks to act as an intermediary for the conversion of
                our Virtual Items to "real world" money, in any fashion, directly, indirectly or otherwise, shall not be held responsible for any consequences arising from the
                operation of such secondary market.

                Investigation
            </p>
            <p>
                In jurisdictions where online gambling is deemed unlawful and we are of the reasonable belief that you may be engaging in "real world" money gambling, then we may
                investigate your use of our Services at our sole discretion and without prior notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                An investigation may include, but will not be limited to the following actions;
            </p>
            <p>
                1. monitoring and/or keeping record of the volume of transactions that pass through our Services;
            </p>
            <p>
                2. monitoring and/or keeping record of known associates within any club that uses our Services;
            </p>
            <p>
                3. requesting information, explanation, or detail about any observed conduct that we consider may be useful in ascertaining any club or user activity taken within
                our Services; and
                4. referring any collected information to the appropriate authority where such investigation yields information or evidence that may reasonably indicate a breach of
                the gambling laws of that jurisdiction. For example, in Australia, information may be passed on to the Australian Communications and Media Authority ("ACMA"),
                Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre ("AUSTRAC") or other relevant authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree to cooperate with any request, correspondence, show cause letter, or otherwise that may arise as a consequence of our investigation into your conduct. You
                shall additionally indemnify us from any and all direct, indirect, incidental and consequential loss or damage, resulting from your use of our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where you do not comply with any request or Term of this agreement, we reserve our right to suspend your access to our Services until such time as we have received
                a satisfactory response from you. Alternatively, where we have formed the view that any action, conduct or otherwise is in breach of these Terms or any statute
                governing such action or conduct, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to our Services without prior notice to you.

                You are responsible for your interactions with other players. If you have a problem with another player, we are not required to get involved, but we can if we
                desire.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a dispute with another player, you release Vue Test, the Vue Test Corporate Family, and all Vue Test Affiliates from responsibility, claims,
                demands, and/or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, resulting from that dispute or connected to that dispute. This
                includes damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This does not apply to users located in the EEA. If you are located in the EEA, your liability
                vis-à-vis Vue Test is as set forth by the law applicable in the country where you reside.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located in California, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
                or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the
                debtor."

            <p>
                We may allow you to use the Services to initiate SMS or MMS text messages to your friends, family, or other contacts. You are not required to send such text
                messages, you are solely responsible for them, and you understand that standard text messaging and data rates may apply based on your plan with your mobile phone
                carrier. You also understand that Vue Test does not control the recipients, content, or timing of these text messages. If you choose to send text messages
                through the Services, you represent and warrant to us that the recipients of the text messages have appropriately consented to receive the text messages.

                8. PAYMENT TERMS
            </h2>
            <p>
                We provide a service in the form of access to games, Virtual Items, and our other Services. In the Services you may use "real world" money to obtain a limited
                license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                How it Works
            </p>
            <p>
                You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through
                the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Apple or Google).
            </p>
            <p>
                When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on platforms such as Apple or Google, Vue Test is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed
                by the third-party platform's payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform's terms of service for additional information. You can also contact our
                Billing Support team as described below for questions concerning refunds of purchases made through Apple or Google.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Service(s) or Virtual Item(s) that will be
                accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the limited license begins.
            </p>
            <p>
                For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. agree that we will supply the Virtual Items to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and
            </p>
            <p>
                2. if you reside in the European Union (the "EU"), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU's Consumer Rights
                Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.
            </p>
            <p>
                You understand that while you may "earn," "buy," or "purchase" Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any
                Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a
                real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.
            </p>
            <p>
                ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Vue Test IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION
                FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE,
                GOOGLE, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.
            </p>
            <p>
                PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additional Payment Terms
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an Account registered to you. Vue Test may revise the pricing for the goods and
                services it licenses to you through the Services at any time.

                LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID Vue Test, THE Vue Test CORPORATE FAMILY, AND/OR THE Vue Test AFFILIATE IN THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS (180)

            <p>
                Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above, which means these
                limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries. These limitations/exclusions apply fully to New Jersey residents.

            <p>
                These limitations/exclusions do not apply to users located in the EEA. For those users, if Vue Test fails to comply with these Terms, Vue Test is responsible
                for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of Vue Test's breach of these Terms or is a result of Vue Test's negligence, but Vue Test is not
                responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated
                by you and Vue Test at the time we entered into these Terms.

                15. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
            </h2>
            <p>
                THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO PLAYERS IN THE US AND CANADA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our Customer Support team at russo_zhang@163.com. In the event that you and Vue Test can't resolve
                the dispute through Customer Service, you and Vue Test both agree to arbitrate as described below.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and Vue Test Both Agree to Arbitrate
            </p>
            <p>
                By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to
                these Terms), you, Vue Test, and any member of the Vue Test Corporate Family all agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms, Feature Terms, Community
                Rules, your relationship with us, or Vue Test's Services, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the
                claim fits within the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate identified below. This agreement to arbitrate also applies even after you stop using your Vue Test
                account or delete it. (In this Section 15 and in Section 17, you, Vue Test, and any member of the Vue Test Corporate Family may be referred to individually as
                "a party" or collectively as "the parties.")
            </p>
            <p>
                An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, Vue Test, and any member of
                the Vue Test Corporate Family all agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules from lawsuits in court. They
                are less formal than lawsuits in courts and provide limited opportunities to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called
                discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any party does not like the
                arbitrator's decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any party disagrees about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or whether it applies to the dispute, the parties all agree that the arbitrator
                will decide that, too.
                In addition, if you, Vue Test, or a Vue Test Corporate Family member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated, or any party refuses to arbitrate a
                claim that should be arbitrated, any other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You,
                Vue Test, or the Vue Test Corporate Family member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding (i.e., stay the court proceedings) while an arbitration
                proceeding is ongoing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Arbitration Process
            </p>
            <p>
                The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will control any arbitration between you and Vue Test or the Vue Test Corporate Family member, and AAA's
                then-current rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, will be used. You can look at AAA's rules and procedures on
                their website at www.adr.org. If something in these Terms is different from AAA's rules and procedures, then the parties agree to follow these Terms instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on AAA's website (www.adr.org).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you reside outside of the United States, arbitration may take place in the city where you reside at the time of filing. If you reside in the United States,
                arbitration shall be initiated in the State of New York, United States of America. You and Vue Test further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any
                federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
                vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
                submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars
                ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an
                arbitration against Vue Test or a member of the Vue Test Corporate Family and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then
                Vue Test will advance all filing, administrative, and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the
                circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that
                such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Vue Test will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the
                arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set
                forth below). In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil
                Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Vue Test for all such cost and expenses that Vue Test paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA
                rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate
            </p>
            <p>
                The parties all agree that they will go to court to resolve disputes
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Relating to your, Vue Test's, or a Vue Test Corporate Family member's intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade
                secrets, copyrights, or patents);
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Relating to any violation of the Community Rules; or
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Within the jurisdiction of small claims courts.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more information about which court the parties can go to for resolving these types of disputes, see Section 17 (Venue for Legal Disputes Not Subject to
                Arbitration).
            </p>
            <p>
                No Class Actions
            </p>
            <p>
                By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to
                these Terms), you, Vue Test, and the Vue Test Corporate Family all agree that the parties can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                That means:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. The parties agree that neither you nor Vue Test nor any member of the Vue Test Corporate Family can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class
                action, consolidated action, or representative action.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than one person's claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or
                representative arbitration proceeding (unless the parties all agree to change this).
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The parties agree that the arbitrator's decision or award in one person's case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Vue Test players,
                and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other players.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a court decides that this subsection on "No Class Actions" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 15 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action
                Waiver) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But the rest of the Terms, Feature Terms, and Community Rules will still apply.

                Opting out of the Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver
            </p>
            <p>
                You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in this Section 15 by sending us written notice of your
                decision to opt out through Customer Support. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or availability of this opt-out,
                whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set out in this Section 15. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Vue Test
                also will not be bound by them.

                We will give you 60-days' notice by email or through the Services if we change this Section 15 on our Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver. If a court or
                arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Changes to Section 15 on Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver" is not enforceable or valid, then this
                subsection shall be severed from Section 15, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver section in existence
                after you began using the Services.

                If you are located in the United States, you agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural
                provisions) governs the interpretation and enforcement of Section 15 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver). In addition, these Terms and our relationship
                will be governed by New York law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.

            <p>
                If you are located in the United States, judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 must
                be brought in state or federal court in Borough of Manhattan in New York City, unless the parties agree to some other location. You, Vue Test, and the Vue 
                Test Corporate Family all consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Borough of Manhattan in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located anywhere other than the United States, judicial proceedings must be brought in the courts of Ireland, unless the parties all agree to some other
                location. You, Vue Test, and the Vue Test Corporate Family all consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located in Australia and have a complaint, then we encourage you to first discuss the matter with us and we will endeavor to resolve the matter. If the
                dispute is not resolved in this manner (or is not capable of being resolved), or if we have any concerns in respect of the complaint from a regulatory compliance
                perspective, then we will take appropriate steps accordingly. Irrespective of this, we reserve our right to share your information with the ACMA or any other
                relevant regulatory body for the purpose of resolving the complaint or dispute, or to address any other concerns which we may have.

                Feature Terms, or Community Rules is not enforceable, the rest of these Terms, Feature Terms, and Community Rules still apply and are binding, and any unenforceable
