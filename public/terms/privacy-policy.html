            <p>
                When you play Vue Test's games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or platforms (like Apple or Google), any purchases you

                location, and the items purchased. The information Vue Test receives depends on the third-party application. Vue Test's Terms of Service explain our policies
                and terms related to charges, billing, third-party credits, and virtual currencies. Please note that purchases of third-party credits or currencies are also subject
                to those parties' terms of service and privacy policies.

            <p>
                We'll keep a record of any correspondence between us.

                information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your Vue Test User and/or social network ID number. We will also store the communications you
                have with our Customer Service team and any additional information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services.

            <p>
                Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll collect some information from other companies, including social networks, if you access our games through your accounts with those companies or you choose to
                connect your accounts with those companies to our games.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you play Vue Test's games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications,
                including social networks like Facebook, Vue Test may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we
                receive depends on the third-party application, your privacy settings, and, if applicable, your friends' privacy settings on that third-party application.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, Vue Test may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the connected third-party application:
            </p>
            <p>
                • your first and last name;<br />
                • your profile picture or its URL;<br />
                • your user identification number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo;<br />
                • your friends' user ID numbers and other public data;<br />
                • the e-mail address you provided to that third-party application;<br />

                • any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with Vue Test.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application's
                terms of service and privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their
                privacy practices.

                3. How We Use Information We Collect and Our Legal Bases for Processing It
            </h2>
            <p>
                We use your information to provide, personalize, maintain the security of, and improve the Services you use; to maintain our business operations; and to exercise,
                defend or establish our rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use your information under several legal bases, including to perform our contract with you, for our legitimate business interests, to comply with our legal
                obligations, or otherwise with your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide you with the Services you request from us and to improve your gaming experience, but there are
                other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:
            </p>
            <p>
                • to improve and optimize our Services and our players' experiences;<br />
                • to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;<br />

                • to enable players to communicate with each other;<br />
                • to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;<br />
                • to protect the safety and well-being of our players;<br />
                • to protect Vue Test's rights and property in connection with our Services;<br />
                • to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Service;<br />
                • to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;<br />
                • to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;<br />
                • to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and/or<br />
                • to conduct research.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located in the European Countries (defined above in Section 1), our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above depends on what
                the information is and the context in which we collect it.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, we'll normally collect information from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service), where the processing is in
                our legitimate interests (provided that these aren't overridden by your interests or rights), or if we otherwise have your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital
                interests or those of another person (for example, another player).
            </p>
            <p>
                If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we
                are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in
                accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing
                information is mandatory.

                4. How We Share Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                We'll share your information with third parties when you use our Services under the circumstances described in this subsection.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll share some of your information with your friends and other Vue Test players that you're playing with to facilitate your gaming interactions with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties or allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the
                following circumstances:
            </p>
            <p>
                Friends and Other Vue Test Players
            </p>
            <p>
                Vue Test's games and Services support and often encourage you to interact with other players. In many Vue Test games, other players, regardless of whether
                they are your social network friends, will be able to see your player profile (as described above); view descriptions of your in-game activity; and communicate with
                you within our Services. For example, in Vue Test, when you are playing at a table, all the other players at the same table can see your player profile and
                send you an in-game chat message.
            </p>

                Third-Party Advertising Including Behavioral Advertising and Analytics
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll share some of your information with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your interests and to enable us to offer
                some of our Services for free.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games, game features, and other Services for free. These advertisements may include, without limitation, banner
                ads on game boards or Services themselves, as full-screen ads between moves or games, or through an "offer wall" in which third-party advertisers offer to provide
                virtual currency or other in-game items to players in exchange for watching an advertisement or for completing a task, such as signing up for an account with one of
                the advertisers, completing a survey, or finishing a particular game level. Offer walls are hosted by third-party offer wall providers, and the offers are made by
                third-party advertisers, not by Vue Test.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not actively share personal information that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your
                consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable advertisers, ad networks, and offer wall providers to serve you with more relevant ads, they may collect, or we may collect and share with them, the
                following types of information when you use our Services:
            </p>
            <p>
                • performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);<br />
                • certain technical information (like IP address, non-persistent device identifier such as IDFA, and de-identified persistent device identifier such as a hashed
                Android ID);<br />
                • a unique identifier, such as your social network ID or Vue Test player ID; and/or<br />
                • other contextual data about your game play (like your level and session length).<br />
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to serving you with relevant ads, the information collected may be used to:
            </p>
            <p>
                • measure how effective ads are;<br />
                • offer you targeted advertising (both on and off our Services) in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that
                are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising); and/or<br />
                • undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience.

                assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in the transition.

                • You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your

                Managing Personal Information, We Receive From Third-Party Applications / Platforms And From Your Mobile Device
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage the information, we receive from third-party applications or platforms and from your mobile device, use the tools and settings provided by the third-party
                application and your mobile device.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage the information Vue Test receives about you from a third-party application or platform where you play our games, like Facebook, Apple, Google, you will
                need to follow the third-party application's instructions for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also can manage many aspects of information collection and use from your mobile device by visiting the "settings" page of your mobile device and reviewing the
                access permissions of each Vue Test game / application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Vue Test receives your information from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by Vue Test in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Opting Out of Promotional Communications from Vue Test
            </p>
            <p>
                You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device's settings page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn off push
                notifications by visiting your mobile device's "settings" page. Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game "settings"
                page.
                Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with
                information about the Services you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other
                legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.

                Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising
            </p>
            <p>
                You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile web advertising from third parties, you
                may visit the following websites:
            </p>
            <p>
                • Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising; and<br />
                • Your Online Choices website for EU-based advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad
                tracking settings on your device (such as turning on "Limit Ad Tracking"). You can also reset the "Advertising Identifier" (such as an IDFA) from your mobile
                device's settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous "Advertising Identifier." Further, depending on the
                platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's "AppChoices" app, that offer to provide
                you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by Vue Test. Vue Test does not control or operate these tools or the
                choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in Vue Test's Services after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less
                relevant to your interests.

            <p>
                Our websites and games may contain advertisements from "Third-Party Services," meaning companies other than Vue Test, that may link to their own websites, online

                7. Our Policies Concerning Children
            </h2>
            <p>
                We seek to ensure that we do not collect information from children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, most of our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 (or under 16 for children located in the European Countries)
                (collectively, "Children"). Children are not permitted to use these Services, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from Children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though our Services do not target Children as the primary audience, we may collect age information before allowing a user to proceed for certain Services. For users
                who identify themselves as Children in our age-gate on such Services, if we allow Children to use the Services, we will either provide a version of that Service
                that does not collect, use, or disclose "personal information" (as defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")), except as permitted by COPPA,
                or obtain legally valid parental consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information that is not subject to a COPPA exception from a Child, we will take reasonable measures to
                promptly remove that information from our records.
            </p>

            <p>
                As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our "Affiliated Entities," which are any other corporate entities under common
                ownership with Vue Test, or to our business partners and service providers from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.

            <p>
                Personal information collected in the European Countries may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside of the European Countries. The data we hold may
                also be processed by employees operating outside of the European Countries who work for us, one of our Affiliated Entities, or one of our business partners or
                service providers. This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details, or (ii) the provision of support
                services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely,
                lawfully, and in the manner we describe here. Please note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so the privacy laws applicable to the places where your
                information is transferred to or stored, used, or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws applicable to the place where you are resident.

                9. How Long We Keep Your Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                We'll keep your information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, maintain our legitimate business operations, and/or exercise, defend or
                establish our rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                How long we retain your personal information depends on why we collected it and how we use it, but we will not retain your personal information for longer than is
                necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will retain personal information about you and connected with your account and/or the Services you use from us for as long as you have an active account with us.
                We will take reasonable measures to delete this personal information if you delete your account. However, you acknowledge that we may retain some information after
                you have closed, or we have deleted, your account with us where necessary to enable us to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend, or establish our
                rights.

                10. Security of Your Information
            </h2>
            <p>
                We work hard to protect your information but you also have a role to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the security of your information both online and offline and to ensure that your data is
                treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures vary based upon the sensitivity of your information.
                If you have an account registered directly with Vue Test, your profile information is protected by the password you use to access your Vue Test account. It is
                important that you protect and maintain your Vue Test account's security and that you immediately tell us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget
                the password to your Vue Test account, the Services allow you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. If you access
                our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your Vue Test
                Ocean game accounts without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure
                as well. We urge you to log out of your Vue Test account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.
                When you sign into your Vue Test account or enter payment information, we and our third-party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is
                completely secure. We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, and we cannot guarantee the security of
                your information while it is being transmitted to our Service. Any transmission is at your own risk. If you have questions about the security of our websites,
                please Contact Us.

                11. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
            </h2>
            <p>
                We'll let you know about any material changes to this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you and other players by placing a notice in-game or on www.vue-test.site, or by sending
                you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you before the change becomes effective (and we will ask for your consent where required by law). We may
                supplement this process by placing notices on game blogs, social network pages, and/or player forums. You should periodically check www.vue-test.site and this
                Privacy Policy for updates.
